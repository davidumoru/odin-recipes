    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Delicious crispy shrimp coated in a bread crumb-Parmesan mixture. My family can't get enough of it!</p>
    <p>I would suggest doubling the recipe if you have very large eaters because this is addictive! Serve with pasta and salad.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup water at room temperature</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>½ (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
        <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>1 egg, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped pecans (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li> cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the pan of your bread machine, combine water, 1/4 cup melted butter, vanilla pudding, 1 cup warm milk, egg, 1 tablespoon sugar, salt, bread flour, and yeast. Set machine to Dough cycle; press Start.</li>
        <li>When Dough cycle has finished, turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 17x10 inch rectangle. Spread with 1/2 cup softened butter. In a small bowl, stir together brown sugar, cinnamon, and pecans. Sprinkle brown sugar mixture over dough.</li>
        <li>Butter a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>Roll up dough, beginning with long side. Slice into 16 one-inch slices; place in prepared pan. Let rolls rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake rolls in preheated oven until browned, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir together cream cheese, 1/4 cup softened butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and 1 1/2 teaspoons milk. Remove rolls from oven and let cool until warm; spread frosting over warm rolls.</li>
    </ol>
