    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Here's an easy alternative to buying those famous cinnamon rolls in the mall.</p>
    <p>They taste exactly the same, and the dough is made in the bread machine.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Non- Stick Cooking Spray</li>
        <li>1 Cup, Dry Bread Crumbs</li>
        <li>1 Cup, Shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>2 Cups, Dried Parsley</li>
        <li>1.5 Teaspoons, Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>1 Pound, Shrimp (Peeled and Deveined)</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons, Butter (Melted)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch glass casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and garlic powder in a large resealable plastic bag and shake to mix ingredients together. Add shrimp and shake to coat.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until starting to crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Switch to broil setting until topping is light brown, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
